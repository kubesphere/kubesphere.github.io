[{"body":" This guide walk you through the basic introduction of Porter.\n What is Porter Porter is an open source load balancer designed for bare metal Kubernetes clusters. It\u0026rsquo;s implemented by physical switch, and uses BGP and ECMP to achieve the best performance and high availability.\nWhy We Need Porter As we know, In the cloud-hosted Kubernetes cluster, the cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) usually provide the Load Balancer to assign IPs and expose the service to outside.\nHowever, the service is hard to expose in a bare metal cluster since Kubernetes does not provide a load-balancer for bare metal environment. Fortunately, Porter allows you to create Kubernetes services of type “LoadBalancer” in bare metal clusters, which makes you have consistent experience with the cloud.\nCore Features Porter has two components which provide the following core features:\n  LB Controller \u0026amp; Agent: The controller is responsible for synchronizing BGP routes to the physical switch; The agent is deployed to each node as DaemonSet to maintain the drainage rules;\n  EIP service, including the EIP pool management and EIP controller, the controller is responsible for dynamically updating the EIP information of the service.\n  Integrate with KubeSphere Porter is a subproject of KubeSphere Container Platform, it allows users to integrate with KubeSphere seamlessly.\n","excerpt":"This guide walk you through the basic introduction of Porter.\n What is Porter Porter is an open …","ref":"/docs/overview/","title":"Overview"},{"body":" This guide elaborates on the basic concepts and principles of Porter.\n Principle The following figure describes the principle of Porter. Assuming there is a distributed service deployed on node1 (192.168.0.2) and node2 (192.168.0.6). The service needs to be accessed through EIP 1.1.1.1. After deploying the Example Service, Porter will automatically synchronize routing information to the leaf switch, and then synchronize to the spine and border switch, thus external users can access the service through EIP 1.1.1.1.\nDeployment Architecture Porter serves as a Load-Balancer plugin, monitoring the changes of the service in the cluster through a Manager, and advertises related routes. At the same time, all the nodes in the cluster are deployed with an agent. Each time an EIP is used, a host routing rule will be added to the host, diverting the IP packets sent to the EIP to the local.\nLogic When Porter is deployed as a service in Kubernetes cluster, it establishes a BGP connection with the cluster\u0026rsquo;s border router (Layer 3 switch). When a service with a specific annotation (e.g. lb.kubesphere.io/v1apha1: porter, see Example Service) has been created in the cluster, the service is dynamically assigned an EIP (users can also specify EIP by themselves). The LB controller creates a route and forwards the route to the public network (or private network) through BGP, so that the service can be accessed externally.\nThe Porter LB controller is a custom controller based on the Kubernetes controller runtime, which automatically update the routing information by watching changes of the service.\n","excerpt":"This guide elaborates on the basic concepts and principles of Porter.\n Principle The following …","ref":"/docs/concepts/","title":"Concepts"},{"body":" This guide walk you through how to install Porter on your Kubernetes cluster.\n Installation  Deploy Porter on Bare Metal Kubernetes Cluster Test Porter on QingCloud with a Simulate Router  ","excerpt":" This guide walk you through how to install Porter on your Kubernetes cluster.\n Installation  Deploy …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started"},{"body":" This page elaborates on how to build and test of Porter project from source code.\n Build Prerequisites  Go 1.11, the plugin uses gobgp to create BGP client, and godgp requires Go 1.11. Docker Kustomize，it uses kustomize to dynamically generate the k8s yaml files needed for the cluster. If you need to push the plugin image to the remote private repository, you need to execute docker login in advance.  Steps  Execute git clone https://github.com/kubesphere/porter.git, then enter into the folder. Following with the above guides to modify the config.toml (Under config/bgp/). (Optional）Modify the code according to your needs. (Optional）Modify the parameters of the image according to your needs (Under config/manager). (Optional）Follow the Simulation Tutorial to deploy a Bird node, then modify the BirdIP in hack/test.sh, and run make e2e-test for e2e testing. Modify the IMG name in the Makefile, then run make release, and the final yaml file is under /deploy. Execute kubectl apply -f deploy/release.yaml to deploy porter as a plugin.
