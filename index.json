[{"body":"This document describes the network topology of PorterLB in BGP mode and how PorterLB functions in BGP mode.\nNOTE\nThe BGP mode is recommended because it allows you to create a high availability system free of failover interruptions and bandwidth bottlenecks. To use the BGP mode, your router must support BGP and Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. If your router does not support BGP or ECMP, you can use the Layer 2 mode to achieve similar functionality.  Network Topology The following figure shows the topology of the network between a Kubernetes cluster where PorterLB is installed and a peer BGP router.\nIP addresses and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) in the preceding figure are examples only. The topology is described as follows:\n A Service backed by two Pods is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster, and is assigned an IP address 172.22.0.2 for external access. PorterLB installed in the Kubernetes cluster establishes a BGP connection with the BGP router, and publishes routes destined for the Service to the BGP router. When an external client machine attempts to access the Service, the BGP router load balances the traffic among the master, worker 1, and worker 2 nodes based on the routes obtained from PorterLB. After the Service traffic reaches a node, kube-proxy can further forward the traffic to other nodes for load balancing (both Pod 1 and Pod 2 can be reached over kube-proxy).  PorterLB uses GoBGP (integrated in PorterLB) to establish a BGP connection for route publishing. Two CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), BgpConf and BgpPeer, are provided for users to configure the local and peer BGP properties on PorterLB. BgpConf and BgpPeer are designed according to the GoBGP API.

However, the BGP mode requires your router to support BGP and Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing, which may be unavailable in certain systems. In this case, you can use the Layer 2 mode to achieve similar functionality. The Layer 2 mode requires your infrastructure environment to allow anonymous ARP/NDP packets. If PorterLB is installed in a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster for testing, you need to confirm with your cloud vendor whether anonymous ARP/NDP packets are allowed. If not, the Layer 2 mode cannot be used.   Network Topology The following figure shows the topology of the network between a Kubernetes cluster with PorterLB and a router.\nIP addresses and MAC addresses in the preceding figure are examples only. The topology is described as follows:\n A Service backed by two Pods is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster, and is assigned an IP address 192.168.0.91 for external access. The Service IP address is on the same network segment as the cluster node IP addresses. PorterLB installed in the Kubernetes cluster randomly selects a node (worker 1 in this example) to handle Service requests. After that, PorterLB sends an ARP/NDP packet to the router, which maps the Service IP address to the MAC address of worker 1. If multiple porter-manager replicas have been deployed in the cluster, PorterLB uses the the leader election feature of Kubernetes to ensure that only one replica responds to ARP/NDP requests. When an external client machine attempts to access the Service, the router forwards the Service traffic to worker 1 based on the mapping between the Service IP address and the MAC address of worker 1. After the Service traffic reaches worker 1, kube-proxy can further forward the traffic to other nodes for load balancing (both Pod 1 and Pod 2 can be reached over kube-proxy). If worker 1 fails, PorterLB re-sends an APR/NDP packet to the router to map the Service IP address to the MAC address of worker 2, and the Service traffic switches to worker 2.  NOTE\nThe Layer 2 mode has two limitations:\n Worker 1 and worker 2 work in active-standby mode in terms of traffic forwarding. When a failover occurs, Services in the Kubernetes cluster will be interrupted for a short while. All Service traffic is always sent to one node first and then forwarded to other nodes over kube-proxy in a second hop. Therefore, the Service bandwidth is limited to the bandwidth of a single node, which causes a bandwidth bottleneck.

The BgpConf, BgpPeer, Eip, Deployment and Service described in this document are examples only and you need to customize the commands and YAML configurations based on your requirements.\nInstead of using a real router, this document uses a Linux server with BIRD to simulate a router so that users without a real router can also use PorterLB in BGP mode for tests.\nPrerequisites  You need to prepare a Kubernetes cluster where PorterLB has been installed. You need to prepare a Linux server that communicates with the Kubernetes cluster properly. BIRD will be installed on the server to simulate a BGP router. If you use a real router instead of BIRD, the router must support BGP and Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. In addition, the router must also support receiving multiple equivalent routes from the same neighbor.  This document uses the following devices as an example:\n   Device Name IP Address Description     master1 192.168.0.2 Kubernetes cluster master, where PorterLB is installed.   worker-p001 192.168.0.3 Kubernetes cluster worker 1   worker-p002 192.168.0.4 Kubernetes cluster worker 2   i-f3fozos0 192.168.0.5 BIRD machine, where BIRD will be installed to simulate a BGP router.    Step 1: Install and Configure BIRD If you use a real router, you can skip this step and perform configuration on the router instead.\n  Log in to the BIRD machine and run the following commands to install BIRD:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:cz.nic-labs/bird sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install bird sudo systemctl enable bird NOTE\n BIRD 1.5 does not support ECMP. To use all features of PorterLB, you are advised to install BIRD 1.6 or later. The preceding commands apply only to Debian-based OSs such as Debian and Ubuntu. On Red Hat-based OSs such as RHEL and CentOS, use yum instead. You can also install BIRD according to the official BIRD documentation.     Run the following command to edit the BIRD configuration file:\nvi /etc/bird/bird.conf   Configure the BIRD configuration file as follows:\nrouter id 192.168.0.5; protocol kernel { scan time 60; import none; export all; merge paths on; } protocol bgp neighbor1 { local as 50001; neighbor 192.168.0.2 port 17900 as 50000; source address 192.168.0.5; import all; export all; enable route refresh off; add paths on; } NOTE\n  For test usage, you only need to customize the following fields in the preceding configuration:\nrouter id: Router ID of the BIRD machine, which is usually set to the IP address of the BIRD machine.\nprotocol bgp neighbor1:\n local as: ASN of the BIRD machine, which must be different from the ASN of the Kubernetes cluster. neighbor: Master node IP address, BGP port number, and ASN of the Kubernetes cluster. Use port 17900 instead of the default BGP port 179 to avoid conflicts with other BGP components in the system. source address: IP address of the BIRD machine.    If multiple nodes in the Kubernetes are used as BGP neighbors, you need to configure multiple BGP neighbors in the BIRD configuration file.\n  For details about the BIRD configuration file, see the official BIRD documentation.\n      Run the following command to restart BIRD:\nsudo systemctl restart bird   Run the following command to check whether the status of BIRD is active:\nsudo systemctl status bird NOTE\nIf the status of BIRD is not active, you can run the following command to check the error logs:\njournalctl -f -u bird     Step 2: Create a BgpConf Object The BgpConf object is used to configure the local (Kubernetes cluster) BGP properties on PorterLB.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the BgpConf object:\nvi porter-bgp-conf.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:network.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2kind:BgpConfmetadata:name:defaultspec:as:50000listenPort:17900routerId:192.168.0.2NOTE\nFor details about the fields in the BgpConf YAML configuration, see Configure Local BGP Properties Using BgpConf.    Run the following command to create the BgpConf object:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp-conf.yaml   Step 3: Create a BgpPeer Object The BgpPeer object is used to configure the peer (BIRD machine) BGP properties on PorterLB.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the BgpPeer object:\nvi porter-bgp-peer.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:network.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2kind:BgpPeermetadata:name:porter-bgp-peerspec:conf:peerAs:50001neighborAddress:192.168.0.5NOTE\nFor details about the fields in the BgpPeer YAML configuration, see Configure Peer BGP Properties Using BgpPeer.    Run the following command to create the BgpPeer object:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp-peer.yaml   Step 4: Create an Eip Object The Eip object functions as an IP address pool for PorterLB.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the Eip object:\nvi porter-bgp-eip.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:network.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2kind:Eipmetadata:name:porter-bgp-eipspec:address:172.22.0.2-172.22.0.10NOTE\nFor details about the fields in the Eip YAML configuration, see Configure IP Address Pools Using Eip.    Run the following command to create the Eip object:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp-eip.yaml   Step 5: Create a Deployment The following creates a Deployment of two Pods using the luksa/kubia image. Each Pod returns its own Pod name to external requests.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the Deployment:\nvi porter-bgp.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:porter-bgpspec:replicas:2selector:matchLabels:app:porter-bgptemplate:metadata:labels:app:porter-bgpspec:containers:- image:luksa/kubianame:kubiaports:- containerPort:8080  Run the following command to create the Deployment:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp.yaml   Step 6: Create a Service   Run the following command to create a YAML file for the Service:\nvi porter-bgp-svc.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\nkind:ServiceapiVersion:v1metadata:name:porter-bgp-svcannotations:lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1:porterprotocol.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1:bgpeip.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2:porter-bgp-eipspec:selector:app:porter-bgptype:LoadBalancerports:- name:httpport:80targetPort:8080externalTrafficPolicy:ClusterNOTE\n You must set spec:type to LoadBalancer. The lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1: porter annotation specifies that the Service uses PorterLB. The protocol.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1: bgp annotation specifies that PorterLB is used in BGP mode. The eip.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2: porter-bgp-eip annotation specifies the Eip object used by PorterLB. If this annotation is not configured, PorterLB automatically uses the first available Eip object that matches the protocol. You can also delete this annotation and add the spec:loadBalancerIP field (for example, spec:loadBalancerIP: 172.22.0.2) to assign a specific IP address to the Service. In the BGP mode, you can set spec:loadBalancerIP of multiple Services to the same value for IP address sharing (the Services are distinguished by different Service ports). In this case, you must set spec:ports:port to different values and spec:externalTrafficPolicy to Cluster for the Services. If spec:externalTrafficPolicy is set to Cluster (default value), PorterLB uses all Kubernetes cluster nodes as the next hops destined for the Service. If spec:externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local, PorterLB uses only Kubernetes cluster nodes that contain Pods as the next hops destined for the Service.     Run the following command to create the Service:\nkubectl apply -f porter-bgp-svc.yaml   Step 7: Verify PorterLB in BGP Mode The following verifies whether PorterLB functions properly.\n  In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to obtain the external IP address of the Service:\nkubectl get svc   In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to obtain the IP addresses of the cluster nodes:\n  On the BIRD machine, run the following command to check the routing table.

The Eip, Deployment and Service described in this document are examples only and you need to customize the commands and YAML configurations based on your requirements.\nPrerequisites  You need to prepare a Kubernetes cluster where PorterLB has been installed. All Kubernetes cluster nodes must be on the same Layer 2 network (under the same router). You need to prepare a client machine, which is used to verify whether PorterLB functions properly in Layer 2 mode. The client machine needs to be on the same network as the Kubernetes cluster nodes. The Layer 2 mode requires your infrastructure environment to allow anonymous ARP/NDP packets. If PorterLB is installed in a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster for testing, you need to confirm with your cloud vendor whether anonymous ARP/NDP packets are allowed. If not, the Layer 2 mode cannot be used.  This document uses the following devices as an example:\n   Device Name IP Address MAC Address Description     master1 192.168.0.2 52:54:22:a3:9a:d9 Kubernetes cluster master   worker-p001 192.168.0.3 52:54:22:3a:e6:6e Kubernetes cluster worker 1   worker-p002 192.168.0.4 52:54:22:37:6c:7b Kubernetes cluster worker 2   i-f3fozos0 192.168.0.5 52:54:22:fa:b9:3b Client machine    Step 1: Enable strictARP for kube-proxy In Layer 2 mode, you need to enable strictARP for kube-proxy so that all NICs in the Kubernetes cluster stop answering ARP requests from other NICs and PorterLB handles ARP requests instead.\n  Log in to the Kubernetes cluster and run the following command to edit the kube-proxy ConfigMap:\nkubectl edit configmap kube-proxy -n kube-system   In the kube-proxy ConfigMap YAML configuration, set data.config.conf.ipvs.strictARP to true.\nipvs:strictARP:true  Run the following command to restart kube-proxy:\nkubectl rollout restart daemonset kube-proxy -n kube-system   Step 2: Specify the NIC Used for PorterLB If the node where PorterLB is installed has multiple NICs, you need to specify the NIC used for PorterLB in Layer 2 mode. You can skip this step if the node has only one NIC.\nIn this example, the master1 node where PorterLB is installed has two NICs (eth0 192.168.0.2 and eth1 192.168.1.2), and eth0 192.168.0.2 will be used for PorterLB.\nRun the following command to annotate master1 to specify the NIC:\nkubectl annotate nodes master1 layer2.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1=\u0026#34;192.168.0.2\u0026#34; Step 3: Create an Eip Object The Eip object functions as an IP address pool for PorterLB.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the Eip object:\nvi porter-layer2-eip.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:network.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2kind:Eipmetadata:name:porter-layer2-eipspec:address:192.168.0.91-192.168.0.100interface:eth0protocol:layer2NOTE\n  The IP addresses specified in spec:address must be on the same network segment as the Kubernetes cluster nodes.\n  For details about the fields in the Eip YAML configuration, see Configure IP Address Pools Using Eip.\n      Run the following command to create the Eip object:\nkubectl apply -f porter-layer2-eip.yaml   Step 4: Create a Deployment The following creates a Deployment of two Pods using the luksa/kubia image. Each Pod returns its own Pod name to external requests.\n  Run the following command to create a YAML file for the Deployment:\nvi porter-layer2.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\napiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:porter-layer2spec:replicas:2selector:matchLabels:app:porter-layer2template:metadata:labels:app:porter-layer2spec:containers:- image:luksa/kubianame:kubiaports:- containerPort:8080  Run the following command to create the Deployment:\nkubectl apply -f porter-layer2.yaml   Step 5: Create a Service   Run the following command to create a YAML file for the Service:\nvi porter-layer2-svc.yaml   Add the following information to the YAML file:\nkind:ServiceapiVersion:v1metadata:name:porter-layer2-svcannotations:lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1:porterprotocol.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1:layer2eip.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2:porter-layer2-eipspec:selector:app:porter-layer2type:LoadBalancerports:- name:httpport:80targetPort:8080externalTrafficPolicy:ClusterNOTE\n You must set spec:type to LoadBalancer. The lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1: porter annotation specifies that the Service uses PorterLB. The protocol.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1: layer2 annotation specifies that PorterLB is used in Layer 2 mode. The eip.porter.kubesphere.io/v1alpha2: porter-layer2-eip annotation specifies the Eip object used by PorterLB. If this annotation is not configured, PorterLB automatically uses the first available Eip object that matches the protocol. You can also delete this annotation and add the spec:loadBalancerIP field (for example, spec:loadBalancerIP: 192.168.0.91) to assign a specific IP address to the Service. If spec:externalTrafficPolicy is set to Cluster (default value), PorterLB randomly selects a node from all Kubernetes cluster nodes to handle Service requests. Pods on other nodes can also be reached over kube-proxy. If spec:externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local, PorterLB randomly selects a node that contains a Pod in the Kubernetes cluster to handle Service requests. Only Pods on the selected node can be reached.     Run the following command to create the Service:\nkubectl apply -f porter-layer2-svc.yaml   Step 6: Verify PorterLB in Layer 2 Mode The following verifies whether PorterLB functions properly.\n  In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to obtain the external IP address of the Service:\nkubectl get svc porter-layer2-svc   In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to obtain the IP addresses of the cluster nodes:\nkubectl get nodes -o wide   In the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to check the nodes of the Pods:\nkubectl get po NOTE\nIn this example, the Pods are automatically assigned to different nodes. You can manually assign Pods to different nodes.    On the client machine, run the following commands to ping the Service IP address and check the IP neighbors:\nping 192.168.0.91 ip neigh In the output of the ip neigh command, the MAC address of the Service IP address 192.168.0.91 is the same as that of worker-p001 192.168.0.3. Therefore, PorterLB has mapped the Service IP address to the MAC address of worker-p001.\n  On the client machine, run the following command to access the Service:\ncurl 192.168.0.91 If spec:externalTrafficPolicy in the Service YAML configuration is set to Cluster, both Pods can be reached.\nIf spec:externalTrafficPolicy in the Service YAML configuration is set to Local, only the Pod on the node selected by PorterLB can be reached.\n  ","excerpt":"This document demonstrates how to use PorterLB in Layer 2 mode to expose a Service backed by two …","ref":"/docs/getting-started/usage/use-porter-in-layer-2-mode/","title":"Use PorterLB in Layer 2 Mode"},{"body":"This document describes how to configure PorterLB in BGP mode for Kubernetes cluster nodes deployed under multiple routers. You can skip this document if all Kubernetes cluster nodes are deployed under the same router.\nNOTE\nThis document applies only to the BGP mode. The Layer 2 mode requires that all Kubernetes cluster nodes be on the same Layer 2 network (under the same router).  Network Topology Before Configuration This section explains why you need to perform the configuration. The following figure shows the network topology of a Kubernetes cluster before the configuration.\nIP addresses in the preceding figure are examples only. The topology is described as follows:\n In the Kubernetes cluster, the master and worker 1 nodes are deployed under the leaf 1 BGP router, and the worker 2 node is deployed under the leaf 2 BGP router. PorterLB is only installed under leaf 1 (by default, only one PorterLB replica is installed). A Service backed by two Pods is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster, and is assigned an IP address 172.22.0.2 for external access. Pod 1 and Pod 2 are deployed on worker 1 and worker 2 respectively. PorterLB establishes a BGP connection with leaf 1 and publishes the IP addresses of the master node and worker 1 (192.168.0.3 and 192.168.0.4) to leaf 1 as the next hop destined for the Service IP address 172.22.0.2. Leaf 1 establishes a BGP connection with the spine BGP router and publishes its own IP address 192.168.0.2 to the spine router as the next hop destined for the Service IP address 172.22.0.2. When an external client machine attempts to access the Service, the spine router forwards the Service traffic to leaf 1, and leaf 1 load balances the traffic among the master node and worker 1. Although Pod 2 on worker 2 can also be reached over kube-proxy, router-level load balancing is implemented only among the master node and worker 1 and the Service bandwidth is limited to the bandwidth of the master node and worker 1.  To resolve the problem, you need to label the Kubernetes cluster nodes and change the PorterLB Deployment configuration so that PorterLB is installed on nodes under all leaf routers. In addition, you need to specify the spec:nodeSelector:matchLabels field in the BgpPeer configuration so that the PorterLB replicas establish BGP connections with the correct BGP routers.\nNetwork Topology After Configuration This section describes the configuration result you need to achieve. The following figure shows the network topology of a Kubernetes cluster after the configuration.\nIP addresses in the preceding figure are examples only. The topology is described as follows:\n After the configuration, PorterLB is installed on nodes under all leaf routers. In addition to what happens before the configuration, the PorterLB replica installed under leaf 2 also establishes a BGP connection with leaf 2 and publishes the worker 2 IP address 192.168.1.2 to leaf 2 as the next hop destined for the Service IP address 172.22.0.2. Leaf 2 establishes a BGP connection with the spine router and publishes its own IP address 192.168.1.1 to the spine router as the next hop destined for the Service IP address 172.22.0.2. When an external client machine attempts to access the Service, the spine router load balances the Service traffic among leaf 1 and leaf 2. Leaf 1 load balances the traffic among the master node and worker 1. Leaf 2 forwards the traffic to worker 2. Therefore, the Service traffic is load balanced among all three Kubernetes cluster nodes, and the Service bandwidth of all three nodes can be utilized.  Configuration Procedure Prerequisites You need to prepare a Kubernetes cluster where PorterLB has been installed.\nProcedure NOTE\nThe node names, leaf router names, and namespace in the following steps are examples only. You need to use the actual values in your environment.    Log in to the Kubernetes cluster and run the following commands to label the Kubernetes cluster nodes where PorterLB is to be installed:\nkubectl label --overwrite nodes master1 worker-p002 lb.kubesphere.io/v1alpha1=porter NOTE\nPorterLB works properly if it is installed on only one node under each leaf router. In this example, PorterLB will be installed on master1 under leaf1 and worker-p002 under leaf2. However, to ensure high availability in a production environment, you are advised to installed PorterLB on at least two nodes under each leaf router.

As a sub-project of KubeSphere, PorterLB fits well into the KubeSphere ecosystem. You can seamlessly integrate PorterLB as a plugin with KubeSphere to utilize the abundant features of the KubeSphere ecosystem.\nDuring new feature release, the KubeSphere grayscale release feature allows users to freely distribute traffic among a stable version and a beta version of an application to both ensure service continuity and test the beta version before formally rolling it out.\nIn this article, I am going to introduce how to use KubeSphere and PorterLB to implement grayscale release for an application in a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. To make you quickly understand how it works, I am going to directly use demonstration settings without digging too much into the details. You can obtain detailed guidance from the KubeSphere documentation and PorterLB documentation.\nArchitecture   Grayscale release\nIn the preceding figure, an application Service backed by Pod v1 (stable version) is deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. After grayscale release is configured on KubeSphere, Pod v2 (beta version) is created and users can determine how much traffic is forwarded to Pod v1 and how much to Pod v2. After Pod v2 is fully tested, Pod v1 can be taken offline and Pod v2 will take over all traffic.\n  KubeSphere gateway\nThe application Service is exposed to the outside by using the KubeSphere gateway, which is in effect a Service backed by a Pod that functions as a reverse proxy. An external client uses a path of a domain name to access the application Service. The reverse proxy Pod obtains the mapping between the path and the application Service from a Route object.\n  PorterLB\nPorterLB installed in the Kubernetes cluster sends an ARP packet to the router, and tells the router to forward traffic destined for the gateway Service to node 1. If node 1 fails, the traffic will be forwarded to node 2.\n  Procedure Prerequisites  You need to prepare a Kubernetes cluster, and install KubeSphere and PorterLB in the Kubernetes cluster. On KubeSphere, you need to create a project and an account. The role of the account in the project must be project-admin.

For applications deployed in bare-metal Kubernetes clusters, where cloud-based load balancer implementations are unavailable, Kubernetes has yet to provide a viable LoadBalancer solution.\nPorterLB well addresses this problem. As a sub-project of KubeSphere, PorterLB boosts application containerization in bare-metal Kubernetes environments, and complements the KubeSphere ecosystem in the bare-metal field.\nIn this article, I am going to introduce how PorterLB functions in Layer 2 mode and BGP mode, which are provided for users to expose applications in different scenarios, and the advantages of PorterLB compared with other bare-metal load balancer implementations such as MetalLB.\nBGP Mode In BGP mode, PorterLB publishes routes to a BGP router deployed outside the Kubernetes cluster, and the BGP router forwards Service traffic from external clients to the Kubernetes cluster nodes based on the routes obtained from PorterLB. In this process, PorterLB uses Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing to ensure that all Kubernetes nodes or nodes that contain Pods, depending on the user configuration, are used as next hops by the BGP router.\nThe process of using PorterLB in BGP mode in a Kubernetes cluster is simple:\n Install PorterLB. Configure an IP address pool by using Eip. Configure BGP properties by using BgpConf and BgpPeer. Create a Service and set the Service to use PorterLB, which is similar to what you do to use a load balancer plugin in a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster.  PorterLB can be configured by using the Eip, BgpConf, and BgpPeer CRDs, no other configuration files are required. In addition, as BGP is decentralized, you can use the BGP mode to easily establish a high availability network free of failover interruptions and bandwidth bottlenecks.\nLayer 2 Mode Generally, you are advised to use the BGP mode to expose your Services in a high availability network. However, BGP may be unavailable in certain systems because of security requirements or because the router does not support BGP. In this case, you can use PorterLB in Layer 2 mode to achieve similar functionality.\nIn Layer 2 mode, PorterLB uses ARP packets (for IPv4) or NDP packets (for IPv6) to map the Service IP address to the MAC address of a Kubernetes node. The mechanism of the Layer 2 mode is similar to that of the BGP mode, except that BGP is replaced with ARP/NDP and the router obtains only one route destined for the Service.\nThough the Layer 2 mode does not provide the same high availability as the BGP mode does, it is easier to use (you don\u0026rsquo;t even need to configure BGP properties):\n Install PorterLB. Configure an IP address pool by using Eip. Create a Service and set the Service to use PorterLB.  You can obtain detailed guidance on how to install, configure, and use PorterLB from the PorterLB documentation.\nAdvantages of PorterLB There are other load balancer implementations such as MetalLB designed for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters. Compared with others, PorterLB has the following advantages.\nCloud native To manage IP address pools and BGP properties for PorterLB, you only need to use the kubectl apply command provided by Kubernetes to create CRD objects. To obtain the status information about IP address pools and BGP peers, you can simply run kubectl get to view the status of the CRD objects. No other configuration files are required. In addition, a PorterLB GUI will be available soon, which will further simplify the usage of PorterLB.\nElegant After PorterLB is installed in a Kubernetes cluster, a porter-manager Deployment that contains a porter-manager Pod is created. The porter-manager Pod implements the functionality of PorterLB for the entire Kubernetes cluster. For high availability, you can scale the porter-manager Deployment and assign multiple PorterLB replicas (porter-manager Pods) to multiple cluster nodes. This simple architecture ensures that PorterLB can be easily managed and integrated with other systems.\nFlexible PorterLB can be used in conventional Kubernetes clusters. As a sub-project of KubeSphere, PorterLB also fits well into the KubeSphere ecosystem. You can seamlessly integrate PorterLB as a plugin with KubeSphere to utilize the abundant features of the KubeSphere ecosystem, such as observability and troubleshooting, unified monitoring and logging, centralized storage and networking management, and easy-to-use CI/CD pipelines.\n","excerpt":"Applications deployed on Kubernetes are usually exposed by using LoadBalancer Services, which rely …","ref":"/blog/2021/02/25/porterlb-for-bare-metal-kubernetes-cloud-native-elegant-and-flexible/","title":"PorterLB for Bare-Metal Kubernetes: Cloud Native, Elegant, and Flexible"},{"body":"As we know, the backend workload can be exposed externally using service of type \u0026ldquo;LoadBalancer\u0026rdquo; in Kubernetes cluster.

In cloud-based Kubernetes clusters, Services are usually exposed by using load balancers provided by cloud vendors. However, cloud-based load balancers are unavailable in bare-metal environments. PorterLB allows users to create LoadBalancer Services in bare-metal environments for external access, and provides the same user experience as cloud-based load balancers.
